##### Final Semester. UPDATE 2022.06.03
Public comment period open the final decision to dump radioactive wastewater from Fukushima into the Pacific Ocean. 
##### DISCLAIMER: This essay does not debate the efficacy of Nuclear Energy. 

# Summary
This is a health and safety alert regarding the proposed discharge of radioactive material into the Pacific Ocean. The radiological hazards
on the Fukushima Daiichi site are globally unprecedented for a nuclear power plant. Computer models show half of the Pacific Ocean would be contaminated in less than 57 days, and the radioactive contamination would reach the west coast of the United States in 5-6 months.

The official reports released by TEPCO explicitly admit that it is not possible to completely decontaminate the water before discharging it into the Pacific Ocean. Independent analysys from Greenpeace have published data that radioactive levels far exceed safe levels.

Radioactive waste dumping in the Ocean was banned under international law in 1972. Marine plants produce over 70% of our oxygen and the ocean is vitally important in our strategy to solve Climate Change. During the initial leaks "Monitoring data showed the concentration of Cesium in the waters near Fukushima was 100,000 becquerels per cubic meter, which is 100 times higher than what was detected in the Black Sea after the Chernobyl disaster. "


# Background
Currently there are 1.3 million tons of radioactive water stored in tanks near the site of the original disaster. This process took 11 years and $178 B USD

Modern nuclear powerplants have enhanced safety features and default safe designs which enable them operate to in the event of a power outage. At the same time new developments 



# Proposed Solution. 
Honor the work of the engineering teams for the last 12  , the engineers for the last 12 years.  Fukushima Will become the global beacon for 
img of animale types across tanks , and industry inputs across tanks, iteratively


### Summary of Risks


### Combinatorial Effects
Modern industry has resulted in thousands of synthetic chemicals flooding our natural environment.  Need extensive testing. Pefect opportunity with large isolated equally divided tanks. 


# Water Desalination Future


# Surf Aerosol 
Coastal communities often experience surf aerosols. 



### Top Proposals 
-- concrete lake
-- evaporation
