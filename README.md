# Summary
In a few months, Japan has to make final decision on extending the storage of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima disaster and avoid any into the Pacific Ocean.
This decision would affect residents of the USA and the whole world. In 1972, dumping radioactive waste into the ocean was banned and internationally prohibited. ( The London Convention )

DISCLAIMER: This article does not question or debate the efficacy of Nuclear Energy. It is an analysis of proposed options in the constantly evolving active remediation effort of the powerplant, with emphasis on responsibility to nature.   Proper analysis on the implications of planetary radionuclide discemination as a disposal strategy. 

# Proposed Solution. 
Honor the work of the ,  TEPCO for the last 12  , the engineers for the last 12 years.  Fukushima Will become the global beacon for 

# Background
Currently there is 1.3 million tons of radioactive water stored in tanks near the site of the original disaster. The process took 11 years and $178 B USD

### Combinatorial Effects
Modern industry has resulted in thousands of synthetic chemicals flooding our natural environment.  Need extensive testing. Pefect opportunity with large isolated equally divided tanks.
