# Summary
Japan has opened a public comment period regarding the final decision on storing or dumping radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima disaster into the Pacific Ocean. In 1972, dumping radioactive waste into the ocean was banned and internationally prohibited by the London Convention.




##### DISCLAIMER: This essay does not debate the efficacy of Nuclear Energy. It is only an analysis of the health and safety implications of controlled planetary radionuclide release. Marine plants produce over 70% of our oxygen and the ocean is a resource of incalculable value.


# Background
Currently there are 1.3 million tons of radioactive water stored in tanks near the site of the original disaster. This process took 11 years and $178 B USD

GEOMAR computer models predict half of the Pacific Ocean would be polluted in less than 57 days, and the radioactive contamination would reach the west coast of the United States in 5-6 months. During the initial leaks "Monitoring data showed the concentration of Cesium in the waters near Fukushima was 100,000 becquerels per cubic meter, which is 100 times higher than what was detected in the Black Sea after the Chernobyl disaster.

### Summary 

## Back background
Our oceans are a natural resource of incalculable value. 


Modern nuclear powerplants have enhanced safety features and default safe designs which enable them operate to in the event of a power outage. At the same time new developments 



# Proposed Solution. 
Honor the work of the engineering teams for the last 12  , the engineers for the last 12 years.  Fukushima Will become the global beacon for 
img of animale types across tanks , and industry inputs across tanks, iteratively


### Summary of Risks


### Combinatorial Effects
Modern industry has resulted in thousands of synthetic chemicals flooding our natural environment.  Need extensive testing. Pefect opportunity with large isolated equally divided tanks. 


# Water Desalination Future


# Surf Aerosol 
Coastal communities often experience surf aerosols. 



Natures capacity to withstand radioactive contamination.

The carefully budget radioactive threshold  irreversibly damage the ecological ability to sustain life. 

### Top Proposals 
-- concrete lake
-- evaporation
