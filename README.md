Japan has opened a public comment period on the final decision to dump radioactive wastewater from Fukushima into the Pacific Ocean. 


##### DISCLAIMER: This essay does not debate the efficacy of Nuclear Energy. 

# Summary
This is a health and safety alert regarding the proposed radioactive dumping into the Pacific Ocean. Computer models show half of the Pacific Ocean would be contaminated in less than 57 days, and the radioactive contamination would reach the west coast of the United States in 5-6 months.

Marine plants produce over 70% of our oxygen and the ocean is of central importance in our strategy to solve Climate Change. 



 During the initial leaks "Monitoring data showed the concentration of Cesium in the waters near Fukushima was 100,000 becquerels per cubic meter, which is 100 times higher than what was detected in the Black Sea after the Chernobyl disaster. "


# Background
Currently there are 1.3 million tons of radioactive water stored in tanks near the site of the original disaster. This process took 11 years and $178 B USD

### Summary 

## Back background
Our oceans are a natural resource of incalculable value. 


Modern nuclear powerplants have enhanced safety features and default safe designs which enable them operate to in the event of a power outage. At the same time new developments 



# Proposed Solution. 
Honor the work of the engineering teams for the last 12  , the engineers for the last 12 years.  Fukushima Will become the global beacon for 
img of animale types across tanks , and industry inputs across tanks, iteratively


### Summary of Risks


### Combinatorial Effects
Modern industry has resulted in thousands of synthetic chemicals flooding our natural environment.  Need extensive testing. Pefect opportunity with large isolated equally divided tanks. 


# Water Desalination Future


# Surf Aerosol 
Coastal communities often experience surf aerosols. 



Natures capacity to withstand radioactive contamination.

The carefully budget radioactive threshold  irreversibly damage the ecological ability to sustain life. 

### Top Proposals 
-- concrete lake
-- evaporation
