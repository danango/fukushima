# Alert
#### This is an urgent health and safety alert regarding the proposed discharge of radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean. Computer models show widespread contamination 57 days after start of discharge process, with radioactive contamination reaching the US in 5-6 months thereafter.

## Background 
Fukushima Daiichi is the largest nuclear reactor meltdown in history. It recived the most severe Level 7 rating from the IAEA and contains 854 tons of nuclear fuel in 3 remaining reactors. Decomissioning is estimated to require 40 years, due in part to the unprecedented levels of radiation, measured at record breaking 530 microsieverts / hour. Currently there are 1.3 million tons of radioactive water stored in tanks near the site of the meltdown. Business implications, including storage costs and real estate negotiations, have resulted in a new plan to discharge the tanks into the Ocean.

## Dispersal of radionuclides
Radioactive contamination of the environment by dispersal of radionuclides is much more hazardous and insidious than exposure to a localized radiation source. If the radionuclides enter the water supply, food supply they will continue to emit radiation for hundreds of years, in some cases millions of years.

## Treatment Claims
Official plans released by TEPCO explicitly schedule dumping radioactive material, discharged into the Pacific Ocean. The reports also include expected radiation dose increase in population. Environmental groups pointed out in 2021 that TEPCO's water treatment technology (ALPS) could neither remove tritium or carbon-14, nor completely remove other radioactive isotopes such as strontium- 90, iodine-129 and cobalt-16.

## International Law
International law prohibits disposal of radioactive waste into the Ocean. The international community must uphold our responsibility to safe nuclear energy and international law. Dumping radioactive waste into the ocean sets a dangerous precedent of acceptable behavior for all nations.

## Essence of life
Marine plants produce over 70% of our oxygen. Aquatic invertebrates constitute approximately 90% of life on the planet and play a vital role in ecosystem function. The ocean is critically important in our strategy to solve Climate Change. Irreversibly contaminating the entire Ocean with radioactive materials undermines ecological stability.
 
## Generational Effects
Scientists studying marine wildlife around the reactor site are concerned about the effects of radioactive waste on the aquatic environment. Despite claims that these radionuclides will be diluted and therefore, present in only small quantities, these do not account for the accumulation of radionuclides in consumers higher up in the food chain, including humans. Lab studies have also presented evidence for DNA damage to marine wildlife from extended exposure to radioactive particles, especially those which include the same isotopes as ones found at the Fukushima reactor site. These affected wildlife, some of which are mobile, will then have cascading effects on the environment if mutations are passed on through generations of breeding.
